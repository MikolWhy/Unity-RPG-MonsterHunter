# Monster Fighter
A computer game created with Unity where the player slays mobs, collects coins, and saves their pet lizard through game progression.

## Game Overview
Players will start as a knight on Level 1 of the dungeon. They will encounter a number of different mobs (slimes, ogres, monsters) that will inflict damage up on contact. Players are able to attack and kill mobs with their combat options, collect coins scattered across the map and traverse the dungeon. The player has a health bar of three hearts and after taking damage three times, they will die and respawn at the beginning of the game.
